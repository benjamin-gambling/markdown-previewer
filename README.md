# Markdown Previewer

This project was completed as part of the Free Code Camps Front End Libraries Assignment.

This project was created using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of the project was to create a markdown previewer that shows in real time the markdown code you are writing with instate updates. This shows how well react works when updating state. the convert from markdown i used marker.js to parse the code for me.
